# eclipseone

This project uses the [Eclipse Plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/eclipse_plugin.html) to configure a multi-project Gradle build as a single-project view in the Eclipse IDE, without the use of the Eclipse Gradle Plugin. 

The Gradle Plugin for Eclipse loads each subproject as a separate project within the IDE. With this Gradle plugin, a multiple-project view within Eclipse will look like the screen below (similar to IDEA's Gradle Plugin). In addition, you can keep your IDE lightweight and not have to install the Gradle Plugin.

## Quick Start

1. The master Gradle build file should have the follow snippet:
```
buildscript {
   repositories {
      maven {
         url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
      }
   }
   dependencies {
    classpath "gradle.plugin.kkdt.gradle.eclipseone:eclipseone:0.5"
  }
}

apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'eclipse'
apply plugin: 'kkdt.gradle.eclipseone'
```
2. Execute the Eclipse plugin as normal: `gradle cleanEclipse eclipse`

## Overview

This plugin looks for Java subprojects and will configure their sources and library configurations into the root project's Eclipse Model. Because of this, the convention is as follows:

1. The root project needs the Java plugin: `apply plugin: 'java'`
2. The root project needs the Eclipse plugin: `apply plugin: 'eclipse'`
3. Subprojects that include the Eclipse plugin will not include Eclipse artifacts (removed by this plugin)
4. You will need to run `gradle cleanEclipse eclipse` again if configurations change (i.e. add a new `compile` configuration to a subproject)

## Plugin Model: EclipseOneModel

`EclipseOneModel` is a project extension and is defined as follows:

```
eclipseone {
   jreContainerPath = null // i.e. 'org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER'
   excludedJavaProjects = [] // Java projects to exclude from classpath
   ignoreExcludedJavaProjectsArtifacts = false // set to true to also ignore any jar artifacts from excluded java projects
}
```

### Excluding Projects from Classpath

Suppose the baseline has a subproject that performs a `wsimport` or `xjc` that is taken care of by the build. The `eclipseone` model can be configured to exclude the source for that subproject in the IDE if its jar is referenced by another project.

### Override JRE Container

Access restriction can occur when the baseline uses JRE sources when loading the baseline in Eclipse (see this [StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36636345/gradle-rt-jar-access-restriction)). Override the `jreContainerPath` in the plugin model to use `org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER` fixes this issue - the one generated by the Eclipe Plugin is something like 

```
org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER/org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.launcher.StandardVMType/JavaSE-1.8/

vs. (the overriden)

org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER
```

## Building

Publish to a Maven-style file repository.

```
gradle publish
```

Publish to local Maven (classpath dependencies would just be `classpath "gradle.plugin.kkdt.gradle.eclipseone:eclipseone:0.5"`).

```
gradle publishToMavenLocal
```
